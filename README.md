## Project Overview
I am considering starting a bike-sharing compant in Des Moines, Iowa.  I first used Tableau to fully understand how the successful bike-sharing program was already working in NYC.  I then applied what I learned about NYC to create a plan that could work for a future bike-sharing program in DesMoines.  

## Results
Based on the visualizations in my Tableau Story, there are five key findings we can conclude about VitiBike use in NYC.  

### 5 Key Findings
* The most popular pick-up and drop-off locations for CitiBike in NYC are around tourist locations, in the heart of the city.
(images of pick-up and drop-off)



* Most users rent the bikes for short trips of approximately 5 minutes.
(checkout times image)



* Male users rent the bikes more often than females.  
(checkout times by gender image)




* There are more trips during rush hours during the week (8am-9am and 5pm-7pm) which suggest the bikes are being used to commute to work.

* The evening commute is the busiest time of the day for CitiBike.

* Male users "commute" more than females.
(trips by gender)



* More users are regular customers that subscribe to the CitiBike service, as opposed to short-term customers.

There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt)
There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)


## Summary
Most CitiBike users are regular subscribers that use the bikes for commuting short distances, perhaps as the last portion of their journey after they take the bus or subway.  

Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

* Trips by User Types - This shows that casual users rent more bikes on the weekends but subscribers still outnumber them.

* Checkout Times by User Type - We can predict that most subscribers will use the bikes for short periods of time but there isn't as strong a correlation for casual users.

* I would additionally try to get data for other months of the year so we can track bike usage annually.  It would be helpful to know if usage increases for holidays or if it decreases with less commuters.
