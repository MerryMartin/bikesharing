# bikesharing


## Project Overview
I am considering starting a bike-sharing compant in Des Moines, Iowa so I used Tableau to understand how the successful bike-sharing program is already working in NYC.    

## Results
Based on the visualizations in my Tableau Story, there are five key findings we can conclude about CitiBike use in NYC.

### 5 Key Findings
* The most popular pick-up and drop-off locations for CitiBike in NYC are around tourist locations, in the heart of the city.

* Most users rent the bikes for short trips of approximately 5 minutes.

* Male users rent the bikes more often than females.

* There are more trips during rush hours during the week (8am-9am and 5pm-7pm) which suggest the bikes are being used to commute to work.

* The evening commute is the busiest time of the day for CitiBike.

* Male users "commute" more than females.

* More users are regular customers that subscribe to the CitiBike service, as opposed to short-term customers.

## Summary
Most CitiBike users are regular subscribers that use the bikes for commuting short distances, perhaps as the last portion of their journey after they take the bus or subway.  

### Additional Helpful Visualizations

* Trips by User Types - This shows that casual users rent more bikes on the weekends but subscribers still outnumber them.

* Checkout Times by User Type - We can predict that most subscribers will use the bikes for short periods of time but there isn't as strong a correlation for casual users.

* I would additionally try to get data for other months of the year so we can track bike usage annually.  It would be helpful to know if usage increases for holidays or if it decreases with less commuters.
